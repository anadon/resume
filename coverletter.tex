%I was thinking about something more clearly establishing my programming and sys admin skill set, and performance last summer.

%Intent
With a breadth of programming and system administration experience across all levels of programming, architecting software, and system administration I can quickly pick up and perform any duties requested.  With path experience working in MTU IT, the on-boarding process should be quick and easy with a known record of advocating the interests of users and technical flexibility.  Please accept this cover letter for the role of System Administrator and Programmer/Analyst.


%Skillset

With a number of groups on campus, I have worked in embedded, web, system, and scientific works.  Work has consistently been completed to a high degree of quality with thorough documentation when possible.  I have worked extensively with Java, C++, SQL, and enough other languages that the last one I picked up, Fortran, took an hour.  

%reference to last summer

Last summer, I was an intern in the newly created Research Support Group under Jen Terlep.  In this role, I was responsible for rebuilding and updating the Immersive Visualization System, able to leverage prior experience to more easily work with the requests and needs of several research groups in Computer Science.  My tasks also included a few server decommissions, and I actively sought out work during idle time while making reasonable thorough documentation for everything.

%Human assurance

Thank you for your time in reviewing my candidacy.  If you have any additional information you might like, feel free to contact me.
